        " Very good experience dealing with them and it's hassle free experience as well. Reached my home on time for my car inspection and was given good price compared to other dealers. Best part is there is hidden charges and also they will take care of documentation for RC transfer. Well done, keep it up! Edit: Would have given 5 ðŸŒŸ had if the payment was processed on the same day!. I understand your server was down for the whole day!. Also I waited for more than half an hour when your agent come to pick my car just to get the payment processed!!. Overall it was good experience and 4 ðŸŒŸ is what I felt is fair! Thank you.",

I not only received the best value of my car but also an excellent customer experience by Mr Vishal, who explained me step by step process and closed the deal successfully. Also a shout out to the car inspector Mr Raghu who made a home visit to inspect the car and explained the inspection details. I highly recommend to visit this branch and experience the difference. Thanks car dekho team",

        "I have sold my car at Euvande. I didn't even have to visit the place. Everything was done at the comfort of home. The TRA at Whitefield center, Mr Nagaraj visited my apartment, done the inspection and got the instant payment without any hassle. I had earlier visited cars24 and was not happy with the price. But, I got the expected price from CarDekho gaadi store. I would really recommend it to anyone who is planning to sell the car. Not just the car price, entire process was really seamless and very responsive. Kudos to the team, and special thanks to Mr Nagaraj.",

I would like to thank Nagaraj for his professionalism and CarDekho for providing me the right price and hassle free selling of my car.",
